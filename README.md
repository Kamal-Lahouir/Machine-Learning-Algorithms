This repository contains algorithms related to Machine Learning.

The files that contains the codes of the models are in src/modules.
The implementations are represented in notebooks for more visualisation. 

Finally the algorithms are : 
I. Classification algorithms
1. Perceptron algorithm
2. Adalin algorithm
3. Pocket algorithm

II. Regression algorithms
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression

NB: the repository is still in progress, so many changes are to occur.
